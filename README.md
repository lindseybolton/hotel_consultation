# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

## Client Scenario
In this mock scenario, we were approached by a hotel who ahd been experiencing high cancellation rates. They wanted solutions to predict whether a guest would cancel their booking and how to mitigate this risk.

## Predictive Model
- **Decision Tree Model:** Created to classify clients as "WillCancel" or "WillNotCancel" based on relevant features.

## Recommendations
1. **Predictive Model:** Implement predictive model to determine probability of the reservation being cancelled.
2. **Target Groups:** Target corporate groups by offering incentives and raising cancellation fees.
3. **Loyalty Program:** Create a loyalty program that prioritizes repeat guests, allowing them to reserve rooms earlier.
4. **Restructuring:** Restructure what room type 1 and 4 offer and how the value proposition is communicated to guests.
